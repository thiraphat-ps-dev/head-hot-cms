- Implement proper validation for all content fields
- Follow REST API patterns for custom endpoints
- Use Payload's built-in authentication and authorization
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow security best practices for database connections

## Code Style

- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types)
- Write descriptive comments for complex business logic
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Implement proper error boundaries and validation

## Payload-Specific Instructions

- When creating collections, use proper field types and validation
- Implement access control for sensitive content
- Use hooks for custom business logic
- Follow Payload's plugin architecture for extensions
- Use proper database indexing for performance

## Testing

- Write unit tests for custom logic
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Validate collection configurations
- Test authentication and authorization flows
